# Contributing to Typing Speed Test

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Typing Speed Test project! ðŸŽ‰

## Code of Conduct

This project is open to everyone. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check if the issue already exists. When you create a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what behavior you expected**
- **Include screenshots** if possible
- **Specify your operating system and Qt version**

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **A detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Examples of how the enhancement would be used**
- **Mockups or sketches** if applicable

### Development Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add amazing feature that does X"
   ```
6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**

### Coding Standards

#### C++ Guidelines
- Use **C++17** features when appropriate
- Follow **RAII principles**
- Use **smart pointers** instead of raw pointers when possible
- Prefer **const correctness**
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**

#### Qt Guidelines
- Use **Qt's signal/slot mechanism** for communication
- Follow **Qt's memory management** patterns (parent-child ownership)
- Use **Qt's container classes** when appropriate
- Follow **Qt's coding conventions**

#### Code Style
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Braces**: Opening brace on same line
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions: `camelCase`
  - Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

Example:
```cpp
class ExampleClass : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit ExampleClass(QObject *parent = nullptr);
    void doSomething();

private slots:
    void onButtonClicked();

private:
    void helperFunction();
    
    QString memberVariable;
    static const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
};
```

### Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Test your changes across different scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure changes don't negatively impact performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Consider compatibility with different operating systems

### Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Add comments for complex logic
